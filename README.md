# Using LSTM Networks To Forecast Oil Prices

There has been much speculation as to whether models such as LSTM can be used to forecast asset prices - in this example, oil.

In reality, trying to forecast asset prices using machine learning models can often be a futile exercise - asset prices constantly fluctuate based on trading activity, and any advantage yielded by a predictive method would quickly be eroded as the market becomes more efficient over time. This is particularly true when dealing with short-term fluctuations in the market - which is subject to a high degree of automated trading by highly sophisticated financial institutions.

However, that is not to say that models such as LSTM cannot be of some value in forecasting a time series, including that of asset prices.
