# Using LSTM Networks To Forecast Oil Prices

There has been much speculation as to whether models such as LSTM can be used to forecast asset prices - in this example, oil.

In reality, trying to forecast asset prices using machine learning models can often be a futile exercise - asset prices constantly fluctuate based on trading activity, and any advantage yielded by a predictive method would quickly be eroded as the market becomes more efficient over time. This is particularly true when dealing with short-term fluctuations in the market - which is subject to a high degree of automated trading by highly sophisticated financial institutions.

However, that is not to say that models such as LSTM cannot be of some value in forecasting a time series over a longer-term period, including that of asset prices.

In this regard, an LSTM model is built to forecast oil price fluctuations, with the dataset encompassing the time period May 1987 - September 2019. The [Brent Oil prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mabusalah/brent-oil-prices/data) is sourced from Kaggle.
